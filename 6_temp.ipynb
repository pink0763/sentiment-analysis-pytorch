    "Spatial invariance is the feature of neural network thanks to which the model is capable of recognizing the same features even if they are a bit different, have different texture, shape or orientation. The max-pooling operation simply takes the maximum value from the max-pooling box that is applied to the feature map. High numbers on the feature map are representing the high similarity to given feature, so by taking the maximum values we will get rid of irrelevant features, and at the same time because we take the maximum from for example the 2x2 box we enable spatial invariance of the model because it doesn't matter if the feature is located on the top left corner or bottom right corner of the max-pooling box we still are able to extract that feature.\n",
